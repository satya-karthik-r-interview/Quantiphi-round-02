mus t continual ly obtain mor e ener gy to replenish that used b y the man y ener gy-requiring chemical r eactions that constantl y tak e plac e.
Together , all of the chemical r eactions that tak e plac e inside c ells , including those that c onsume or g ener ate ener gy , are
referred to as the c ell ’ smetabolism . FIGURE 4.2Ultimat ely , mos t life forms g et their ener gy from the sun . Plants use phot osynthesis

as a major ener gy sour ce , because sugar molecules ha ve a gr eat deal o f ener gy stored within their bonds . For the mos t

r eaction is summariz ed as : Because this pr ocess involves synthesizing an ener gy-storing molecule , it requir es ener gy input t o proceed . During the
light r eactions o f phot osynthesis , ener gy is pr ovided b y a molecule cal led adenosine triphosphat e ( ATP ) , which is the primar
y ener gy curr ency o f all cells . Jus t as the dol lar is used as curr ency t o buy g oods , cells use molecules
o f ATP as ener gy curr ency t o per form immediat e work . In c ontr ast , ener gy-storage molecules such as gluc ose ar e
consumed onl y to be br oken do wn t o use their ener gy . The r eaction that har vests the ener gy of a sug ar molecule
in cells requiring o xygen to sur vive can be summariz ed b y the r everse r eaction t o phot osynthesis . In this r eaction , oxygen
is c onsumed and carbon dio xide is r eleased as a w aste product . The r eaction is summariz ed as : Both o f these r eactions
in volve man y steps . The pr ocesses o f making and br eaking do wn sug ar molecules il lustrate tw o examples o f metabolic path ways
. A metabolic path way is a series o f chemical r eactions that tak es a s tarting molecule and modifies it , s tep-by-step , through a series
o f metabolic int ermediat es , eventual ly yielding a final pr oduct . In the e xample o f sug ar metabolism , the firs t metabolic path
way synthesiz ed sug ar fr om smal ler molecules , and the other path way broke sug ar do wn into smal ler molecules . These tw o opposit
e processes—the firs t requiring ener gy and the sec ond pr oducing ener gy—are referred to as anabolic path ways ( building pol ymers ) and catabolic path ways
( br eaking do wn pol ymers into their monomers ) , r espectiv ely . Consequentl y , metabolism is c omposed o f synthesis ( anabolism ) and
degr adation ( catabolism ) ( Figure 4.3 ) . It is impor tant t o kno w that the chemical r eactions o f metabolic path ways do not
tak e plac e on their o wn . Each reaction s tep is facilitat ed , or catal yzed , b y a pr otein cal led an enzyme
. Enzymes ar e impor tant f or catal yzing al l types o f biological r eactions —those that r equir e ener gy as w ell as those
that r elease ener gy . FIGURE 4.3Catabolic path ways are those that g ener ate ener gy by breaking do wn lar ger molecules . Anabolic path ways are
those that requir e ener gy to synthesiz e lar ger molecules . Both types o f path ways are requir ed for maintaining the c ell ’ s ener

relevant t o a par ticular case o f ener gy transfer is cal led a s ystem , and e verything outside o f that mat ter is cal
led the surr oundings . For ins tanc e , when heating a pot o f water on the s tove , the s ystem includes the s tove ,
the pot , and the water . Ener gy is tr ansferred within the s ystem ( betw een the s tove , pot , and w ater ) .
Ther e are tw o types o f systems : open and closed . In an open s ystem , ener gy can be e xchang ed with its surr
oundings . The s tovetop s ystem is open because heat can be los t to the air . A closed s ystem can not e xchang e ener gy
with its surr oundings . Biological or ganisms ar e open s ystems . Ener gy is e xchang ed betw een them and their surr oundings as the y
use ener gy from the sun t o per form phot osynthesis or c onsume ener gy-storing molecules and r elease ener gy to the environment b y doing w
ork and r eleasing heat . Lik e all things in the ph ysical w orld , ener gy is subject t o ph ysical laws . The la ws
of thermodynamics g overn the tr ansfer of ener gy in and among al l systems in the univ erse . In gener al , ener gy is defined as
the ability t o do w ork , or t o create some kind o f chang e. Ener gy exists in diff erent forms . For example , electrical
ener gy , light ener gy , and heat ener gy are all diff erent types o f ener gy . To appr eciat e4.1 • Ener gy and Me
tabolism 91the w ay ener gy flo ws int o and out o f biological s ystems , it is impor tant t o unders tand tw o of the
ph ysical la ws that govern ener gy . Thermodynamics The firs t law of thermodynamics s tates that the t otal amount o f ener gy in the univ
erse is c onstant and c onser ved . In other w ords , ther e has al ways been , and al ways wil l be , exactl y
the same amount o f ener gy in the univ erse . Ener gy exists in man y diff erent f orms . According t o the firs t law
of thermodynamics , ener gy ma y be tr ansferred fr om plac e to plac e or tr ansformed int o diff erent f orms , but it can
not be cr eated or des troyed . The tr ansfers and transformations o f ener gy tak e plac e around us al l the time . Light bulbs
tr ansform electrical ener gy int o light and heat ener gy . Gas s toves tr ansform chemical ener gy from natur al gas int o heat ener gy
. Plants per form one o f the mos t biological ly useful ener gy transformations on ear th : that o f converting the ener gy of sunlight t
o chemical ener gy stored within or ganic molecules ( Figure 4.2 ) . Some e xamples o f ener gy transformations ar e sho wn in Figure 4.4 .
The chal leng e for al l living or ganisms is t o ob tain ener gy from their surr oundings in f orms that the y can tr ansfer
or transform int o usable ener gy to do w ork . Living c ells ha ve evolved to meet this chal leng e. Chemical ener gy stored within or
ganic molecules such as sug ars and fats is tr ansferred and tr ansformed thr ough a series o f cellular chemical r eactions int o ener gy within molecules
o f ATP . Ener gy in A TP molecules is easil y accessible t o do w ork . Examples o f the types o f work that c

do w ork ma y seem simple . Ho wever , the second la w of thermodynamics e xplains wh y these task s are har der than the y
appear . All ener gy transfers and transformations ar e ne ver complet ely efficient . In e very ener gy transfer , some amount o f ener gy is
los t in a f orm that is unusable . In mos t cases , this f orm is heat ener gy . Thermodynamical ly , heat ener gyis defined
as the ener gy transferred fr om one s ystem t o another that is not w ork . F or example , when a light bulb is turned on
, some o f the ener gy being c onverted fr om electrical ener gy int o light ener gy is los t as heat ener gy . Likewise ,
some ener gy is los t as heat ener gy during c ellular metabolic r eactions . An impor tant c oncept in ph ysical s ystems is that o
f order and disor der . The mor e ener gy that is los t by a s ystem t o its surr oundings , the les s ordered and
mor e random the s ystem is . Scientis ts refer to the measur e of randomnes s or disor der within a s ystem as entr opy . High
entr opy means high disor der and lo w ener gy . Molecules and chemical reactions ha ve varying entr opy as w ell . For example , entr opy
incr eases as molecules at a high c oncentr ation in one plac e diffuse and spr ead out . The sec ond la w of thermodynamics sa ys that
ener gy wil l always be los t as heat in ener gy transfers or tr ansformations . Living things ar e highl y ordered , r equiring c onstant
ener gy input t o be maintained in a s tate of low entr opy . Potential and Kine tic Ener gy When an object is in motion , ther
e is ener gy associat ed with that object . Think o f a wr ecking bal l. Even a slo w- moving wr ecking bal l can do a
gr eat deal o f damag e to other objects . Ener gy associat ed with objects in motion is calledkinetic ener gy ( Figure 4.5 ) . A speeding
bul let , a w alking person , and the r apid mo vement o f molecules in the air ( which pr oduc es heat ) al l have
kinetic ener gy . Now what if that same motionles s wr ecking bal l is lift ed tw o stories abo ve ground with a cr ane ? If
the suspended wrecking bal l is unmo ving , is ther e ener gy associat ed with it ? The ans wer is y es . The ener gy that
w as requir ed to lift the wr ecking bal l did not disappear , but is no w stored in the wr ecking bal l by vir tue o
f its position and the f orce of gravity acting on it . This type o f ener gy is cal ledpotential ener gy ( Figure 4.5 ) . If
the bal l were to fal l , the pot ential ener gy would be tr ansformed int o kinetic ener gy until al l of the pot ential ener
gy was e xhaus ted when the bal l rested on the gr ound . W recking bal ls also s wing lik e a pendulum ; thr ough the
s wing , ther e is a c onstant chang e of pot ential ener gy ( highes t at the t op o f the s wing ) to
kinetic ener gy ( highes t at the bot tom o f the s wing ) . Other e xamples o f potential ener gy include the ener gy of
water held behind a dam or a person about t o sky dive out o f an airplane . FIGURE 4.5Still water has pot ential ener gy ; mo ving
w ater , such as in a w aterfall or a r apidl y flo wing riv er , has kinetic ener gy . ( credit `` dam `` :
modification o f work b y `` Pascal '' /Flickr ; cr edit `` waterfall '' : modification o f work b y Frank Gual tieri ) Potential ener gy
is not onl y associat ed with the location o f mat ter , but also with the s tructur e of mat ter . Even a spring on the
gr ound has pot ential ener gy if it is c ompr essed ; so does a rubber band that is pul led taut . On a molecular le vel
, the bonds that hold the at oms o f molecules t ogether e xist in a par ticular s tructur e that has potential ener gy . Remember that
anabolic c ellular path ways requir e ener gy to synthesiz e comple x molecules fr om simpler ones and catabolic path ways release ener gy when c omple x
molecules ar e broken do wn . The fact that4.1 • Ener gy and Me tabolism 93ener gy can be r eleased b y the br eakdown o f certain
chemical bonds implies that those bonds ha ve pot ential ener gy . In fact , ther e is pot ential ener gy stored within the bonds o f all
the f ood molecules w e eat , which is e ventual ly harnes sed f or use . This is because these bonds can r elease ener gy when
br oken . The type o f pot ential ener gy that exists within chemical bonds , and is r eleased when those bonds ar e broken , is cal
led chemical ener gy . Chemical ener gy is r esponsible f or pr oviding living c ells with ener gy from f ood . The r elease o f

ne xt ques tion is the f ollowing : Ho w is the ener gy associat ed with these chemical r eactions quantified and e xpressed ? How can the
ener gy released fr om one r eaction be c ompar ed to that o f another r eaction ? A measur ement o f free ener gy is used
t o quantif y these ener gy transfers . Recal l that ac cording t o the sec ond la w of thermodynamics , all ener gy transfers in volve
the los s of some amount o f ener gy in an unusable f orm such as heat . F ree ener gy specifical ly refers t o the ener
gy associat ed with a chemical r eaction that is a vailable aft er the los ses ar e ac count ed for . In other w ords , free
ener gy is usable ener gy , or ener gy that is a vailable t o do w ork . If ener gy is r eleased during a chemical r
eaction , then the chang e in fr ee ener gy , signified as ∆G ( del ta G ) wil l be a negative number . A neg ative
chang e in fr ee ener gy also means that the pr oducts o f the r eaction ha ve les s free ener gy than the r eactants ,
because the y release some fr ee ener gy during the r eaction . R eactions that ha ve a negative chang e in fr ee ener gy and c
onsequentl y release fr ee ener gy are cal ledexergonic r eactions . Think : exergonic means ener gy isexiting the s ystem . These r eactions ar e also
r eferred to as spontaneous r eactions , and their pr oducts ha ve les s stored ener gy than the r eactants . An impor tant dis tinction mus
t be dr awn betw een the term spontaneous and the idea o f a chemical r eaction oc curring immediat ely . Contr ary to the e veryday use
o f the term , a spontaneous r eaction is not one that suddenl y or quickl y oc curs . The rus ting o f iron is an e
xample o f a spontaneous r eaction that oc curs slo wly , little b y little , over time . If a chemical r eaction absorbs ener gy rather
than r eleases ener gy on balanc e , then the ∆G f or that r eaction wil l be a positiv e value . In this case , the
pr oducts ha ve mor e free ener gy than the r eactants . Thus , the pr oducts o f these reactions can be thought o f as ener
gy-storing molecules . These chemical r eactions ar e cal ledender gonic r eactions and the y are non-spontaneous . An ender gonic r eaction wil l not tak e

Two reactants might also ent er a r eaction and both bec ome modified , but the y lea ve the r eaction as tw o products . The location

chemical r eactions that in volve mor e than one subs trate by bringing the subs trates together in an optimal orientation f or reaction . Another w ay in
which enzymes pr omot e the r eaction o f their subs trates is b y creating an op timal en vironment within the activ e sit e for the

inhibition , an inhibit or molecule is similar enough t o a subs trate that it can bind t o the activ e sit e and simpl y block the

A drug tar get is a molecule that is lit erally the tar get of the drug . In the case o f statins , HMG -CoA r eductase is
the drug tar get . Drug tar gets ar e identified thr ough pains taking r esear ch in the labor atory . Identif ying the tar get alone is

, which ma y be supplied b y an or ganism ’ s diet or , in some cases , produc ed b y the or ganism . Feedback Inhibition
in Me tabolic P athways Molecules can r egulate enzyme function in man y ways . The major ques tion r emains , however : What ar e these molecules
and wher e do the y come fr om ? Some ar e cofactors and c oenzymes , as y ou ha ve learned . What other molecules in the

In a mos t efficient and eleg ant way , cells ha ve evolved to use the pr oducts o f their o wn r eactions f or feedback inhibition
o f enzyme activity . Feedback inhibition involves the use o f a reaction pr oduct t o regulate its o wn fur ther pr oduction ( Figure 4.11 )
. The cell responds t o an abundanc e of the pr oducts b y slo wing do wn pr oduction during anabolic or catabolic r eactions . Such r

, is an impor tant r egulatory mechanism in c ells . The pr oduction o f both amino acids and nucleotides is c ontr olled thr ough f eedback

pr ocess that cr eates ATP . In this w ay , when A TP is in abundant suppl y , the c ell can pr event the pr oduction

A TP is used t o po wer the majority o f ener gy-requiring cellular r eactions . ATP in Living S ystems A living c ell can not s

to fill any ener gy need o f the c ell . Ho w ? It functions as a r echar geable bat tery . When A TP is br

t o do w ork b y the c ell , usual ly by the binding o f the r eleased phosphat e to another molecule , thus activ ating
it . For example , in the mechanical w ork o f muscle c ontr action , A TP supplies ener gy to mo ve the c ontr actile muscle
proteins . ATP S tructure and F unction At the hear t of ATP is a molecule o f adenosine monophosphat e ( AMP ) , which is c omposed
o f an adenine molecule bonded t o both a ribose molecule and a single phosphat e group ( Figure 4.12 ) . Ribose is a fiv e-carbon sug ar

The addition o f a phosphat e group t o a molecule r equir es a high amount o f ener gy and r esul ts in a high-ener gy

so A TP yield depends on the tis sue being consider ed . Another fact or that aff ects the yield o f ATP molecules g ener ated fr om

and lipid metabolic path ways •Explain wh y metabolic path ways are not c onsider ed closed s ystems You ha ve learned about the catabolism o f gluc ose
, which pr ovides ener gy to living c ells . But living things c onsume mor e than jus t gluc ose f or food . Ho w does
a turk ey sandwich , which c ontains pr otein , pr ovide ener gy to your c ells ? This happens because al l of the catabolic path ways
for carboh ydrates , proteins , and lipids e ventual ly connect int o glycolysis and the citric acid cy cle path ways ( Figure 4.20 ) . Metabolic path
ways should be thought o f as por ous—that is , subs tanc es ent er fr om other path ways , and other subs tanc es lea ve for
other path ways . These path ways are not closed s ystems . Man y of the pr oducts in a par ticular path way are reactants in other path
ways . Connec tions o f Other Sugar s to Gluc ose Me tabolism Glycogen , a pol ymer o f gluc ose , is a shor t-term ener gy
storage molecule in animals . When ther e is adequat e ATP present , e xcess gluc ose is c onverted int o glycogen for storage . Glycogen is made
and s tored in the liv er and muscle . Glycogen wil l be tak en out o f storage if blood sug ar le vels dr op . The
pr esenc e of glycogen in muscle c ells as a sour ce of gluc ose al lows ATP to be pr oduc ed for a long er time during
e xercise . Sucr ose is a disac charide made fr om gluc ose and fruct ose bonded t ogether . Sucr ose is br oken do wn in the
smal l intestine , and the gluc ose and fruct ose ar e absorbed separ ately . Fruct ose is one o f the thr ee dietar y monosac charides
, along with gluc ose and g alact ose ( which is par t of milk sug ar , the disac charide lact ose ) , that ar e absorbed
dir ectly int o the bloods tream during dig estion . The catabolism o f both fruct ose and g alact ose pr oduc es the same number o f
ATP molecules as gluc ose . Connec tions o f Proteins t o Gluc ose Me tabolism Proteins ar e broken do wn b y a v ariety o f
enzymes in c ells . Mos t of the time , amino acids ar e recycled int o ne w proteins . If ther e are excess amino acids ,
however , or if the body is in a s tate of famine , some amino acids wil l be shunt ed int o path ways of gluc ose catabolism
. Each amino acid mus t have its amino gr oup r emo ved prior t o entr y into these path ways . The amino gr oup is c
onverted int o ammonia . In mammals , the liv er synthesiz es ur ea fr om tw o ammonia molecules and a carbon dio xide molecule . Thus ,
urea is the principal w aste product in mammals fr om the nitrogen originating in amino acids , and it lea ves the body in urine . Connec tions o
f Lipids t o Gluc ose Me tabolism The lipids that ar e connect ed to the gluc ose path ways are choles terol and trigl ycerides . Choles terol
is a lipid that contribut es to cell membr ane fle xibility and is a pr ecursor o f steroid hormones . The s ynthesis o f choles terol starts
with ac etyl CoA and pr oceeds in onl y one dir ection . The pr ocess can not be r eversed , and A TP is not pr oduc
ed . Triglycerides ar e a f orm o f long-t erm ener gy storage in animals . Triglycerides s tore about twic e as much ener gy as carboh
ydrates . Triglycerides ar e made o f glycerol and thr ee fat ty acids . Animals can mak e mos t of the fat ty acids they need .
T riglycerides can be both made and br oken do wn thr ough par ts of the gluc ose catabolism path ways . Glycerol can be phosphor ylated and pr
oceeds thr ough gl ycolysis . Fatty acids ar e broken int o tw o-carbon units that enter the citric acid cy cle.108 4 • Ho w Cells Ob tain

If these c ells reproduc ed suc cessfully and their numbers climbed s teadil y , it follows that the c ells would begin t o deplet e the nutrients

Catabolic r eactions br eak do wn c omple x chemicals int o simpler ones and ar e as sociat ed with ener gy release . Anabolic pr ocesses build
c omple x molecules out o f simpler ones and r equir e ener gy . In studying ener gy , the t erm s ystem r efers t o
the matter and en vironment in volved in ener gy transfers . Entr opy is a measur e of the disor der o f a s ystem . The physical
la ws that describe the tr ansfer of ener gy are the la ws of thermodynamics . The firs t law states that the t otal amount o f ener
gy in the univ erse is c onstant . The sec ond la w of thermodynamics s tates that e very ener gy transfer in volves some los s of
ener gy in an unusable f orm , such as heat ener gy . Ener gy comes in different f orms : kinetic , pot ential , and fr ee
. The chang e in free ener gy of a reaction can be neg ative ( releases ener gy , exergonic ) or positiv e ( consumes ener gy ,
ender gonic ) . Al l reactions r equir e an initial input o f ener gy to proceed , cal led the activ ation ener gy . Enzymes ar
e chemical catal ysts that speed up chemical r eactions b y lowering their activ ation ener gy . Enzymes ha ve an activ e sit e with a unique
chemical environment that fits par ticular chemical r eactants f or that enzyme , cal led subs trates . Enzymes and subs trates ar e thought t o bind ac
cording t o an induc ed-fit model . Enzyme action is r egulated to conser ve resour ces and r espond op timal ly to the environment . 4.2Glycolysis ATP
functions as the ener gy curr ency f or cells . It al lows cells to store ener gy briefl y and tr anspor t it within itself to suppor
t ender gonic chemical r eactions . The structur e of ATP is that o f an RNA nucleotide with thr ee phosphat e groups at tached . As A
TP is used f or ener gy , a phosphat e group is detached , and ADP is pr oduc ed . Ener gy deriv ed fr om gluc ose
catabolism is used t o rechar ge ADP int o ATP . Glycolysis is the firs t path way used in the br eakdown o f gluc ose t o
extract ener gy . Because it is used b y nearl y all organisms on ear th , it mus t have evolved earl y in the history of life
. Glycolysis c onsis ts of two par ts : The firs t part prepar es the six -carbon ring o f gluc ose f or separ ation int o
tw o thr ee-carbon sug ars . Ener gy from ATP is in vested int o the molecule during this s tep to ener gize the separ ation . The
sec ond half o f glycolysis extracts A TP and high-ener gy electr ons fr om h ydrogenatoms and at taches them t o NAD+ . Two ATP molecules are
invested in the firs t half and f our A TP molecules ar e formed during the sec ond half . This pr oduc es a net gain o f
two ATP molecules per molecule o f gluc ose f or the c ell . 4.3Citric A cid C ycle and Oxidativ e Phosphor ylation The citric acid cy cle
is a series o f chemical r eactions that r emo ves high-ener gy electr ons and uses them in the electr on tr anspor t chain t o gener
ate ATP . One molecule o f ATP ( or an equiv alent ) is pr oduc ed per each turn o f the cy cle . The electr on
tr anspor t chain is the por tion o f aer obic respir ation that uses fr ee o xygen as the final electr on acceptor for electr ons r
emo ved fr om the int ermediat e compounds in gluc ose catabolism . The electr ons ar e passed thr ough a series o f chemical r eactions ,
with a smal l amount o f free ener gy used at thr ee points t o transpor t hydrogen ions acr oss the membr ane . This contribut es
to the gr adient used in chemiosmosis . As the electr ons ar e pas sed fr om NADH or F ADH 2down the electr on tr anspor t chain
, the y lose ener gy . The products o f the electr on tr anspor t chain ar e water and ATP . A number o f intermediat e
compounds can be diverted int o the anabolism o f other biochemical molecules , such as nucleic acids , non-es sential amino acids , sug ars , and lipids .
These same molecules , except nucleic acids , can ser ve as ener gy sour ces for the gluc ose path way . 4.4Fermentation If NADH can not be metaboliz
ed thr ough aer obic respir ation , another electr on ac ceptor is used . Mos t organisms wil l use some f orm o f fermentation t o
accomplish the r egener ation o f NAD+ , ensuring the continuation o f glycolysis . The r egener ation o f NAD+in fermentation is not ac companied b y

Cal vin cy cle . In the light - dependent r eactions , which tak e plac e at the th ylak oid membr ane , chlor ophyll absorbs ener
gy from sunlight and then c onverts it int o chemical ener gy with the use o f water . The light -dependent r eactions r elease o xygen fr

ener gy deriv ed from the light -dependent r eactions driv es both the cap ture of carbon in carbon dio xide molecules and the subsequent as sembl y of
sug ar molecules . The tw o reactions use carrier molecules t o transpor t the ener gy from one to the other . The carriers that mo ve ener

. Humans can see onl y a fr action o f this ener gy , which is r eferred to as “ visible light . ” The manner in which
solar ener gy travels can be described and measur ed as w aves . Scientis ts can det ermine the amount o f ener gy of a w ave by
measuring its wavelength , the distanc e betw een tw o consecutiv e , similar points in a series o f waves , such as fr om cr est to

( credit : Jason Hol linger ) How Light -Dependent R eactions W ork The o verall purpose o f the light -dependent r eactions is t o convert light
ener gy int o chemical ener gy . This chemical ener gy wil l be used b y the Cal vin cy cle t o fuel the as sembl y
of sug ar molecules . The light -dependent r eactions begin in a gr ouping o f pigment molecules and pr oteins cal led a photosystem . Phot osystems e
xist in the membr anes o f thylak oids . A pigment molecule in the phot osystem absorbs one photon , a quantity or “ pack et ” of light
ener gy , at a time . A phot on o f light ener gy travels until it r eaches a molecule o f chlor ophyll . The phot on
causes an electr on in the chlor ophyll to bec ome “ excited. ” The ener gy giv en to the electr on al lows it t o break fr
ee fr om an at om o f the chlor ophyll molecule . Chlor ophyll is ther efore said t o “ donat e ” an electr on ( Figure
5.12 ) . To replac e the electr on in the chlor ophyll , a molecule o f water is split . This split ting r eleases an electr on
and r esul ts in the f ormation o f oxygen ( O 2 ) and h ydrogen ions ( H+ ) in the th ylak oid spac e. Technical
ly , each br eaking o f a w ater molecule r eleases a pair o f electr ons , and ther efore can r eplac e tw o donat
ed electr ons.122 5 • Pho tosynthesis Access f or free at opens tax.orgFIGURE 5.12 Light ener gy is absorbed b y a chlor ophyll molecule and is pas sed
along a path way to other chlor ophyll molecules . The ener gy culminat es in a molecule o f chlor ophyll found in the r eaction c enter .
The ener gy “ excites ” one o f its electr ons enough t o lea ve the molecule and be tr ansferred to a nearb y primar y electr
on ac ceptor . A molecule o f water splits t o release an electr on , which is needed t o replac e the one donat ed . Oxy
gen and h ydrogen ions ar e also f ormed fr om the split ting o f water . The r eplacing o f the electr on enables chlor ophyll
to respond t o another phot on . The o xygen molecules pr oduc ed as byproducts find their w ay to the surr ounding en vironment . The h
ydrogen ions pla y critical r oles in the r emainder o f the light -dependent r eactions . Keep in mind that the purpose o f the light -dependent
r eactions is t o convert solar ener gy int o chemical carriers that will be used in the Cal vin cy cle . In euk aryotes and some pr
okaryotes , two phot osystems e xist . The firs t is cal led phot osystem II , which w as named f or the or der o f its
disc overy rather than f or the or der o f the function . After the phot on hits , phot osystem II tr ansfers the fr ee electr on
to the firs t in a series o f proteins inside the thylak oid membr ane cal led the electr on tr anspor t chain . As the electr on
pas ses along these pr oteins , ener gy from the electr on fuels membr ane pumps that activ ely mo ve hydrogen ions ag ains t their c oncentr
ation gr adient fr om the stroma int o the th ylak oid spac e. This is quit e analog ous t o the pr ocess that oc curs in
the mit ochondrion in which an electr on tr anspor t chain pumps h ydrogen ions fr om the mit ochondrial s troma acr oss the inner membr ane and
int o the int ermembr ane spac e , creating an electr ochemical gr adient . Aft er the ener gy is used , the electr on is ac cepted
by a pigment molecule in the ne xt phot osystem , which is cal led phot osystem I ( Figure 5.13 ) .5.2 • The Light -Dependent R eactions o

the ener gy from the electr on to pump h ydrogen ions int o the int erior o f the th ylak oid . A pigment molecule in phot osystem
I ac cepts the electr on . Gener ating an Ener gy C arrier : ATP In the light -dependent r eactions , ener gy absorbed b y sunlight is
s tored b y tw o types o f ener gy-carrier molecules : ATP and NADPH . The ener gy that these molecules carr y is s tored in a
bond that holds a single at om or gr oup o f atoms t o the molecule . For ATP , it is a phosphat e group , and f
or NADPH , it is a h ydrogen at om . R ecal l that NADH w as a similar molecule that carried ener gy in the mit ochondrion fr

, the y each lose either at oms or gr oups o f atoms t o become the lo wer-ener gy molecules ADP and NADP+ . The buildup o f
hydrogen ions in the th ylak oid spac e forms an electr ochemical gr adient because o f the diff erence in the c oncentr ation o f protons (
H+ ) and the diff erence in the char ge acr oss the membr ane that the y create . This potential ener gy is har vested and s tored
as chemical ener gy in A TP thr ough chemiosmosis , the mo vement o f hydrogen ions do wn their electr ochemical gr adient thr ough the tr ansmembr
ane enzyme A TP s ynthase , jus t as in the mitochondrion . The h ydrogen ions ar e allowed to pas s thr ough the th ylak oid
membr ane thr ough an embedded pr otein c omple x called A TP s ynthase . This same pr otein g ener ated A TP fr om ADP in
the mit ochondrion . The ener gy gener ated b y the hydrogen ion s tream al lows ATP s ynthase t o attach a thir d phosphat e to
ADP , which f orms a molecule o f ATP in a process cal led phot ophosphor ylation . The flo w of hydrogen ions thr ough A TP s
ynthase is cal led chemiosmosis , because the ions mo ve from an ar ea o f high t o low concentr ation thr ough a semi-permeable s tructur e.
Gener ating Ano ther Ener gy C arrier : NADPH The r emaining function o f the light -dependent r eaction is t o gener ate the other ener gy-carrier
molecule , NADPH . As the electr on fr om the electr on tr anspor t chain arriv es at phot osystem I , it is r e-ener gized with
another phot on captured b y chlor ophyll . The ener gy from this electr on driv es the f ormation o f NADPH fr om NADP+and a h ydrogen
